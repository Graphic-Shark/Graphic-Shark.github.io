								<p>Welcome to my site, I'm the Graphic Shark: Viscous Design. Did you know that if a shark stops swimming, it dies? Sharks constantly have to be on the move, and I'm the same way with design, I keep striving to get better and push the boundaries of what I know. Throughout my career I've learned a wide range of skills, from animation to graphic and web design. But the waters I feel most comfortable in are UX.</p>
								<p>User experience in my opinion is the math behind the design. Nothing makes me happier than figuring out the equation that leads to a better user centered design. Whether It's as simple as fixing a button so user takes that last step, or a complete change to the whole motivation flow, I love being a part of it all. I've done work for local startups that have needed a complete experience overhaul. Conduction user testing, creating stories, personas, journey maps, the whole lot! I've also worked with national companies like Fidelity who already had a lot of these UX tools available and needed some UX direction to interpret it for their various projects. Big or small, no matter the size of the project, if the user's journey becomes a better one, then my goal has been reached.</p>
								<p>I hope you enjoy my site, I built it myself(did I mention I code too?). If you have any questions or feel like you'd benefit from some UX love on your own site or project, drop me a line and I'll take a bite at: <a href="mailto:graphicshark@gmail.com">graphicshark@gmail.com</a></p>
