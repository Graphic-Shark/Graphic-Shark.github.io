		<h1>Beacon Homes Redesign</h1>
		<p>I created this website for a client that had their wordpress website hacked and wanted just a static HTML/CSS site. For some of the more advanced features I used a combination of Boostrap and Angular JS.</p>

		<h3>Tools Used</h3>

		<p>A lot of the site design came from the client. He really wanted something that looked more physical than the solid flat colors that are the current style. He also wanted a gallery to show off all the photos he had for each build. In order to maintain the gallery as well as the clients changes, I used arrays in Angular Js models and made a maintainable SASS file to keep up with color and branding changes.</p>
