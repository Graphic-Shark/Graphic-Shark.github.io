		<h1>RANLife File Transfer</h1>
		<p>This was a quick re-design of RANLife Home Loans file transfer site. The main reason for this redesign was to make the site responsive to allow for mobile device uploads. I took it a few steps further by adding in some UI elements to make the overall function of the website more intuitive.</p>
