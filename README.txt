This website is for my personal/professional use as well as for meeting requirements for my BYU-I Capstone Project. This website will be built using Angular JS, SASS, as well as any other frameworks that allow me to show off my skills and knowledge in front-end development and design. If you would like to see my full portfolio before this site is finished, please look over at https://www.behance.net/GraphicShark
